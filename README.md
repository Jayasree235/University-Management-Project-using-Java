# University-Management-Project-using-Java
This program allows users to manage students, professors, and courses within a university setting. It utilizes features like Array Lists to store data efficiently and provides functionalities like adding new students, professors, courses, enrolling students in courses, assigning courses to professors, and displaying information about students, professors, and courses. The program also offers a user-friendly menu-driven interface for easy interaction. This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, and user input/output in Java.
